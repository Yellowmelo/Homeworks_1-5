# PP1 
  #The initial roll was not a 6, therefor we concluded the die was fair
  #The die being unfair has probability P(6) = 1/6 or 16.67% 
  #initially thinking the probability of a fair die was 1-P(6) , however with hindsight the Probability of the die being fair depends on how one judges the die

#PP2
  #In my trial the data was, Roll20 <- data.set(2,	5,	2,	4,	2,	4,	3,	3,	5,	5,	4,	4,	6,	4,	1,	3,	2,	5,	6,	6,
    #Findings were that P(6) occured 3 times
    #Decision ruling is if P(6) occurs > 3 times, the die is unfair
  #Considering the stats question if fair dice are rolled 20 times, what is likely number of 6 resulting? 
    #Given that fair die P(6) = 1/6 , then after 20 tries , Probability is 1/6*20 or 3.33
  #When 1 more or less rolls are added we do not see a significant change notating the die to be unusual, same net probability for +/- proposing the rolls following the Law of Large Numbers or diminishing margins of return

#PP3
  #Decision ruling is if P(6) occurred => 20 then the die is unfair
  #In simulating 100 rolls R provided the below data with results of P(6) occuring 19 times, therefor die is fair
    #how_many_rolls <- 100
    #sim_rolls <- sample(1:6, how_many_rolls, replace = TRUE)
    #sum(sim_rolls == "6")

  #In analyzing, it is fair to say that there is some confidence level atached to this and any conclusion depending on the observer. Boundaries would be subjective to the observers
